As we work through class remotely (hey, at least no more commuting!),
And we learn to talk on Zoom (please don't forget about the muting!),
Let's first have a little fun before the code starts executing.
Please enjoy this crow-sourced poem about Statistical Computing:

This isn't "twitch writes a poem", but just as good.
I hope you're all ready to maximize some likelihoods!

R you, oh R you as ready as I am to be out of quarantine? 
On the bright side, perhaps we'll come out of this shiny and well, with an extra shiny app to spare.
