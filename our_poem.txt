As we work through class remotely (hey, at least no more commuting!),
And we learn to talk on Zoom (please don't forget about the muting!),
Let's first have a little fun before the code starts executing.
Please enjoy this crow-sourced poem about Statistical Computing:

This isn't "twitch writes a poem", but just as good.
I hope you're all ready to maximize some likelihoods!

After teaching us R, I hope you will be understood.
After the class is finished, I hope I got as much work done remotley as I could.

The boredom has set in and the anxiety is growing.
Let's hope they diminish as we begin coding. 

Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary...
Just kidding I'm not Poe, now to program in R I go!
